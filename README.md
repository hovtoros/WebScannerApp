# WebScannerApp
A simple program to scan a web page via URL and determine some information about web elements contained.
#### Used technologies
- Python 3.8
- Selenium WebDriver

# Getting Started
The program was developed on *Windows* platform, hence consider it running on the same, otherwise you will have problems with preincluded *Chrome Driver* executable.

To run the application, you need to have preinstalled the following firmware:
- ### Python 3.8
This version of the framework should be configured as the project interpreter.

Also Selenium library should be included for Python, with the following pip command:
```cmd
pip install selenium
```

- ### Chrome browser version 83
Chrome driver is included with the this repo under the path ***/resources/chromedriver.exe***

The later is supposed to interact with v.83 Chrome browsers only.
